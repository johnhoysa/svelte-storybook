# Getting Started

This is a work in progress.

Once you've downloaded the project from GitHub run `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) to load all the dependencies.

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Storybook

To start Storybook:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
